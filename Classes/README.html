<h2>NSAttributedString HTML Additions</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This project aims to duplicate the methods present on Mac OSX which allow creation of <font face="Courier" color="blue">NSAttributedString</font> from HTML code.
This is useful for drawing simple rich text - like this document - without having to use a UIWebView.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>At <em>present</em> the following tags are <b>supported</b>:</p>
<ul><li>H1-H6</li><li>P</li><li>B, I, STRONG, EM</li><li>FONT (face and color, not size). It would be great if we could support many more styles</li></ul>
<p>Currently attributes are inherited by enclosed tags via 'brute force'. I don't know if this is accurate.</p>
<h3>To Do</h3>
<p>There is still quite a few more things to do on the project. OL, UL, DEL, possibly CSS styles as they related to fonts and text formatting.</p>
<p>If you find brief test cases where the created <font face="Courier" color="blue">NSAttributedString</font> differs from the version on OSX please send them to us!</p><p>Follow <font color="red">@cocoanetics</font> on Twitter</p>
